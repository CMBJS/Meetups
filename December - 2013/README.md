OPEN JAM TALKS @ #CMBJS Meetup 2 (Gets are deeper, sets are shallow)

Have an idea to share? An experience to describe? A passion to spread?Join us 
on the Open Jam talk stage, we want to hear about it!


####WHY OPEN JAM TALKS? 
It is fun, it is fast, and interesting. Since the talk is given by experienced 
speakers, should be a learning experience as well. 

“Open Jam talks" are fast, bright and catchy. The focus is on the content of the 
talk. There will be several talks scheduled during the breaks and others on demand. 


####Open jam stage


Anyone at the meetup can convene a session on the Open Jam stage. We encourage 
interactive sessions providing opportunities to explore Agile ideas and techniques. 
Sessions don't need to be formal, like the ones on the program -- it's more fun if they are not! 
Like bees around a jampot, Open Jam is a buzzing place for thought leaders to hang out, 
it’s where juicy conversations about edgy and groundbreaking topics happen. Come along to 
discuss your sticky issues and burning questions. Pick up valuable new insights into topics 
that are relevant to you today.



So please sumbit us if you like to to a Open Jam Talk 
This idea also from DevDay 2013 
(The "Get are deeper sets are shallow" is the one of better things i have learned in DevDay 2013 by Venkat subramaniam)
